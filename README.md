Session Sauce exposes the `sess` command for quick and easy tmux session management.

It allows you as the user to stop caring about which sessions currently exist
by being declarative about which project you want to switch to. If a session
exists you'll be switched there. If it doesn't, it will be created, then you'll
be switched there, detaching any current session (if one exists).

`sess` also handles your `TMUX` context for you, opening a tmux client if you're
outside of one, and switching sessions of the current client if you're already
inside tmux. No more `sessions should be nested with care, unset $TMUX to force`
messages!

Note: All subcommand names can optionally be shortened to their first letter.
E.g. `sess s` is equivalent to `sess switch`

## Compatibility

session-sauce should work on most linux and mac machines, and works with most bash-compatible shells.

Installation options:

* copy-paste `session-sauce.plugin.zsh` onto your machine and source it from your shell's `rc` file. (E.g. `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`)
* Add to your ZSH plugin manager as `ChrisPenner/session-sauce`

Although the script has a `zsh` suffix it should be fully compatible with all shells that can interpret `bash`.

## Dependencies:

**fzf**:

Find installation instructions here: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf
Or `brew install fzf` on a Mac

**tmux**:

Find installation instructions here: https://github.com/tmux/tmux
Or `brew install tmux` on a Mac

## Configuration

### `SESS_PROJECT_ROOT`

Export this variable from your zshrc or bashrc file.
This should contain a list of `:` separated absolute paths to directories
where you keep your projects.
Projects in this directory will be used as options
for the `sess switch` command.
Periods in project directory names will be replaced with underscores in the
corresponding session names due to tmux session naming restrictions
(tmux/tmux@9ee93b3).

### tmux bindings

You can set up tmux bindings to pop a side pane for switching sessions so you don't have to type an explicit shell command.
This is handy when you're running things like vim and don't want to jump out to a prompt in order to switch sessions.

Throw these into your `.tmux.conf` and customize the binding to whatever you like.

```
bind-key C-s split-window -v "zsh -ic 'sess switch'"
bind-key C-l split-window -v "zsh -ic 'sess choose'"
```

This runs `zsh` in script mode using an interactive shell so that it loads your ZSH plugins (like session-sauce).
Otherwise it's likely that `sess` won't be on your path, or that your `SESS_PROJECT_ROOT` won't be set.

If your login shell is quite slow to start up, you may want to use simply `zsh -c` and explicitly source only the `session-sauce` script, but I'll leave that up to you.

## Usage

### Smart session switch

```sh
$ sess switch [query]
```

Interactively select a session from a list of your project directories
(configured by `SESS_PROJECT_ROOT`) as well as all existing sessions.

This is the most versatile and useful command.
Running simply `sess` will be expanded to `sess switch`

An optional query can be provided to pre-fill the fzf window.
If there is only one match for the query the result
will be selected automatically.

### Explicitly create a new session

```sh
$ sess new [session-name]
```

Normally you'll just use `sess switch` to create sessions,
but `sess new` can be used to explicitly create new session
in the current directory.

This can be useful for creating sessions for projects
outside of `SESS_PROJECT_ROOT`.

If no session name is provided the directory name will be used, with periods
replaced with underscores due to tmux session naming restrictions
(tmux/tmux@9ee93b3).

### List all active sessions

```sh
$ sess list
```

List all the active sessions.


### Choose an active session

```sh
$ sess choose [query]
```

Interactively select a session from a list of all active sessions.
Unlike 'sess switch' this does NOT include projects from `SESS_PROJECT_ROOT`.

An optional query can be provided to pre-fill the fzf window.
If there is only one match for the query the result
will be selected automatically.


### Kill an active session

```sh
$ sess kill [query]
```

Interactively select a session from a list of all active sessions to kill.

An optional query can be provided to pre-fill the fzf window.

Use Tab to select multiple sessions to kill.

### Version

```sh
$ sess version
```

Display the currently installed version of sess.

### Help
```sh
$ sess help
```

Displays this usage info.
